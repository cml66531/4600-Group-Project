/**
 *  Name of Game: Dungeon Dash
 *  Team Name: I'm Sorry MIS Jackson
 *  Team Members: Chris Levy, Sarah Duvall, Thomas DeLay
 *  Game Description: You start out in the grand hall of a castle and must travel around its unique rooms
 *  looking for a key that gives you access to the hidden chest which contains all of the kings gold.
 *  Newly Added Features: 10 rooms, a key, a chest, and a music component.
 *  Bugs: None
 *  
 *  This class is the main class of the Dungeon Dash application. 
 *  
 *  This main class creates and initialises all the others: it creates all
 *  rooms, creates the parser and starts the game.  It also evaluates and
 *  executes the commands that the parser returns.
